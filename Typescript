Javascript Basics and OOPS

- HTML and CSS can be used to implement static web pages.
- Javascript is used to add the dynemic functionality.

Limitations of Javascript:
- It is not a typesafe.
- It is a interpreter based language, so that if we are not following proper syntax will get exceptions not the errors.
- Debugging is a bit difficult.
- In Javascript we can have OOPS but implementation is difficult.

Type Script: 
- It is not a replacement of Javascript and it is not adding any new features to the javscript.
- Typescript = Javascript + Datatypes (Superset of javascript).

Advantages:
- It is a typesafe scripting langauge.
- It is a compiler based language (Compilation Errors).
- Once if the type script is compiled it generates Javascript only.
- It supports OOPS similar to server side programming experience.
- There are morethan 40+ langauges which are superset of Javascript
	- PureScript
	- CoffieScript
	- TypeScript
	- LiveScript etc.
- TS was introduced by Microsoft and author is "Andrew Hezelsibeg".

Features of Typescript:
- Datatypes
- var and let and const.
- for..in and for..of
- Classes and Objects
- OOPS
- Abstract classes and Interfaces
- Modules
- Generics
- await and async etc.

Software Requirements:
	- IDE(Visual Studio Code).
	- Node.Js
	- Install the Typescript

Datatypes in TS:
- A datatype which can be used to specify the type of the data that the variable can have.
- To create a variable in TS we use "var/let/const".
Syntax:  var <variableName>: <datatype> = value;
Example: var x:number = 10;

Normal Datatypes:
	- number - Used to store numerical value.
	- string - single charecter ('')/ Multiple charecters ("")
	- boolean - eigther we can have true/false

Complex Datatypes:
	- Arrays - We can have similar type of values.
	- Tuples - It is used to store the values of different types.
	- Enums - Used to store the named constants.

Function: 
- It can be used to execute the logic.
- It is reusable component which can be executed again and again when we call.

Creating First TS file:
> Open any code editor and write the TS code.
> Save the file with an extension i.e. <filename>.ts
> Open the location through the command prompt and write command like
	> tsc <filename>.ts [It will generate JS file].
> To execute it we can attach that to a HTML file using script tag.

Difference between var and let keyword?
- var can be used as function scope member, once if it used in block scope and modified that would be impacted.
- let can be used as a block scope.
- Once we define let in a scope we can't redefine it, but var can be defined any number of times
